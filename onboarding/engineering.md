# Onboarding for engineers
You should already be familiar with our general [onboarding document](general.md). The next steps should help you getting started with some engineering specific tasks.

## Buddy
You will typically have a buddy assigned to help you get started and be your first address for questions. They will be responsible for helping you get started and give you some context.

## Playing the user
As a first step, start acquainting yourself with our tech stack from the user's perspective. Head over to [developer.centrifuge.io](https://developer.centrifuge.io) to read up on installing a Centrifuge node and browse through the documentation. Try to get it up and running and extend the docunmentation if you notice anything amiss.

## Understanding our process
We don't follow scrum, waterfall or live in complete chaos. But we are trying to develop an engineering process that works for us. Read up on it [here](../engineering/process.md)

## Comitting code
Now that you know a bit how we work, talk to your buddy and figure out what a first starting issue could be. We typically work in our own forks and use github pull requests. If anything in that process is unclear, you can [read up on it](../engineering/workflow.md).

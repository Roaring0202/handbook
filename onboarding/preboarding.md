# Future employee pre-boarding
Before onboarding, we need to make sure you are ready to pre-board. You were probably sent a 
link to this page before starting work at Centrifuge.

There are a few details we'd like to ask you to answer to prepare everything for your first day:
* Computer:
  * What keyboard layout do you want to use?
  * We generally give everyone a Apple Magic Trackpad or Mouse and a Magic Keyboard. If you have 
    other preferences, though, feel free to let us know and we'll try to accomodate.
  * Depending on your role, we usually get Macbooks, Airs for non technical folks. 15" or 13" Macbook Pro for \
    engineering & other people with more bigger hardware requirements. If you believe you're part of that category, 
    please let us know of the spec you want. 
* Accounts:
  * Please provide us with your GitHub account
  * Personal E-mail Address
  * Mobile Phone Number

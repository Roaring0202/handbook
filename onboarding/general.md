## Oops.. I’m here. What next?
Welcome to Centrifuge! We’re excited to have you on board. This document is meant to give some structure to 
your first week(s) at our amazing company.

## Security
Before setting up any of the tools, head over to our [security policy](../security/README.md) and give it a 
thorough read and keep it in mind when setting up accounts & password.

## Tools & Systems
Start by setting up 1Password. Then use a new auto-generated 20-character password for all new logins. Enable 
2-factor authentication at all services that support it.

We are working in the crypto-world. We will get hacked. Let’s not make it easy for the bad girls and guys. 
Read our [security policy](../it/security.md) and make sure to keep it in mind.

You should have have access to:
* 1Password (sign up with the invite, Martin, Philip or Maex will approve)
* Slack (you should have an invite in your mailbox)
* Expensify (Martin should add you here)

## Making things official
* Send a picture of yourself to Maya so you can be included on our website’s team section 
* Update your profiles to be linked to Centrifuge, if you feel like it, own one etc.: LinkedIn, Angel.co, Facebook, twitter, scuttlebutt

## The buddy system
When joining every new team member is paired with a colleague who can show them the ins and out of our product, tech, processes, culture and team.

The hiring team involved in creating the role for you will find a good buddy for you and introduce you to them before you start. They are here to answer whatever questions you might have, no matter how stupid you think they are. They'll be able to guide you to the right place to find the information you need and focus on helping you start up quickly.

The buddy will focus on:

* Helping you define your first contributions to Centrifuge ensuring you have a fast and successful onboarding.
* Answer any questions for which you don't know who else to ask
* Explain the circle you're in and make sure you're on all the appropriate meetings and syncs for your circle.

## Oops.. I’m here. What next?

Welcome to Centrifuge! We’re excited to have you on board. This document is meant to give some structure to
your first week(s) at our amazing company.

## Security

Before setting up any of the tools, head over to our [security policy](../security/README.md) and give it a
thorough read and keep it in mind when setting up accounts & password.

## Tools & Systems

Start by setting up 1Password. Then use a new auto-generated 20-character password for all new logins. Enable
2-factor authentication at all services that support it.

We are working in the crypto-world. We will get hacked. Let’s not make it easy for the bad girls and guys.
Read our [security policy](../it/security.md) and make sure to keep it in mind.

You should have have access to:

- 1Password: sign in with this [link](https://centrifuge.1password.com/teamjoin/invitation/5AKDCBAIF5GT3FEUZNQSJ4C2JY)
- Slack (you should have an invite in your mailbox)
- HackMD
- Expensify (Aubry should add you here)

### HackMD & Github

We use both HackMD and Github for stuff other than just code (e.g. this repo). We heavily rely on Markdown, a simple text formatting tool. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, you can take a tutorial here: https://www.markdowntutorial.com/ HackMD supports many other things not part of the standard Markdown syntax, you can look at all features here: https://hackmd.io/features?both

If you are not familiar with Github and git, the easiest way to use Git is using the [Github Desktop App](https://help.github.com/en/desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop).

## Making things official

- Send a picture of yourself to Dennis so you can be included on our website’s team section
- Update your profiles to be linked to Centrifuge, if you feel like it, own one etc.: LinkedIn, Angel.co, Facebook, twitter, scuttlebutt

## Scheduling time to talk to your team

When joining, your manager will suggest a few people to talk to. Ask them what a convenient time is for them to meet and talk about their work, tips on how to get started or whatever else you want. Make some friends at Centrifuge!

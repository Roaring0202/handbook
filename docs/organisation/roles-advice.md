Anyone can propose a formal decision at any time. We seek open, transparent decision-making and strive to enable the people who are affected by a decision to participate as fully as possible in making it. Centrifuge tries to make decisions with the widest possible circle of participants, while recognising the necessity and wisdom of delegating responsibility for certain decisions.

A formal decision is only required whenever there is a significant impact on the organization or there is a large-scale cross-team impact. It is difficult to specify exact criteria for every case, so everyone is encouraged to use their best judgement to balance exercising autonomy with gaining shared understanding.

Everyone is encouraged to make smaller decisions in informal ways. Only use the formal decision process when really needed.

Formal decisions are needed for the following areas (some with the whole team, some with a subset of people).
- Agreements, Tools, & Processes – How Centrifuge as a whole will work and communicate
- Cross-team impact – When one circle wants to make a change of how they work and will impact (an) other team(s)
- Money – spending company funds or for actions that impact the financial outlook

At Centrifuge we use a consent-based decision making process. Consent means the absence of objections (blockers). Similar to consensus (where everyone agrees), consent invites group participation in the decision making process. But instead of granting each member the power to mold the proposal in pursuit of a compromise, consent urges the group to accept a “good enough” solution. This allows the group to move faster. After a formal decision making process, a decision is ratified when there are no meaningful or “blocking” objections.

Every proposal has a Proposer. This is the person who is putting forward the proposal. They are the shepherd of the proposal to move it through the process.
This includes creating a clear timeline for comments and feedback to the proposal, incorporating that feedback, setting a clear voting timeline, and making sure those that should vote are aware of these timelines.

It is important that the proposer remains diligent to remind people to comment/vote in the proposal document. However, remember with lazy consent that the implementer is incentivized to get feedback to move forward; and it is ok not to get votes from everyone.

# A memo on location and collaboration

Centrifuge is at home in Berlin. When we started out, we were 4 people spread across 9 hours of time
difference and none of us were less than 2hrs of flight time away. It was not ideal but we have worked
very closely together for many years. Getting on phone calls and traveling to see each other was workable
but as the team grew, we made the conscious decision to have Berlin as the location for our office for
our team. Berlin has a vibrant crypto scene, is an easy place to move to, and overall, as most of you
would probably agree, is a pretty rad place to be. But more importantly, at a stage where we have so
many questions to still figure out, where we are still working on the foundation of our strategy and our
products, having a lot of time in the same room is very important.

Now, in the age of broadband and webcams it's very easy to have a somewhat immersive conversation over many
thousand kilometers but it requires effort and doesn't come close to the real thing. The non-verbal part of
a meeting gets missed by remote attendees. A study found that 7% of any message is conveyed through words, 38%
through certain vocal elements, and 55% through nonverbal elements (facial expressions, gestures, posture, etc).
Apart from that, having a physical location we all call home and share has other advantages. We care a lot about
the people we work with and having a familiar atmosphere and trust in each other is not just important for
feeling comfortable at work but also makes collaboration much more effective. An office filled with peers who
you respect, who can cheer you up and motivate you is, we believe, a valuable ingredient to making Centrifuge a
successful venture. Spontaneity is another ingredient that can lead to great results and is very hard to
replicate in any remote setting.

Centrifuge is at a size where we can act as one coherent tribe, with the dozen or so people we are, it's easy to
form personal relationships and interact with everyone at work in a way that is not possible anymore when we grow
into the few dozens to a hundreds. At that point the social fabric of our company won't be as close-knit anymore
and for merely practical reasons groups will have split up a bit more. How we work together will change when we
reach that point and some decentralization will start to make sense but let's cross that bridge when we get there.

Personal circumstances can change and that could mean moving to another places on this planet. A job should never
keep you from a happy life. Undoubtedly permanently living in another place will change how you're part of our
tribe and your interaction with everyone else. This does not mean we want to exclude this on principle but it
needs to be a consideration.

There are different types of work and they benefit differnetly from in-person or remote setting. There are
situations where locking yourself in a room and not talking to anyone is the right thing to execute on a
specific task with laser-sharp focus. Sometimes the office is just a bit too distracting or Berlin a tad bit
too cold and grey.

In everything we do, we try to have the least process necessary and the minimum rules required. In this
spirit, this document should give you with some guidelines, the reasoning behind them and empower you to make
decisions about where you work and how you work on your own. And if you are in doubt with any of this, bring
it up in the team and ask your peers as working with them is most important and doing that in a way that is
ideal for both you and your peers should be the goal of these guidelines.

# Here Some Guidelines

If you are not in Berlin putting that info in the team calendar so everyone knows. Especially so if you are on
a different timezone than the rest.

When an absences is planned out and longer in time, think about any important events within that timeframe.
Planning sessions, work events, releases. See who else is absent during that time. If the people you're most
closely working together haven't been in one place for the last month, adding another 2 weeks of remote work is
not be the best idea right now. Spending a week together could really be useful for everyone to get back in sync.
Likewise, when two or three people already are on vacation or absent from Berlin, you should probably try to be
around so others in the company can come to you for questions. But it could very well be that precisely that
would be the perfect time to be remote as no one in the office could want anything from you. If necessary check
with your peers and make that call yourself.

As a last consideration, we want the office to have an energetic and motivating atmosphere and a place where you
can get inspired. That becomes a lot harder if our office is empty too often and will have an impact on the people
that do come to the office. Keep this in the back of your head, if you feel like the office is often too empty,
then maybe it's a good idea to adjust your own habits a bit and let your peers know that this is missing.

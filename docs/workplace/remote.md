# Remote Work: location and collaboration

Centrifuge started remote only, then was briefly geographically focused
on Berlin and is spreading out again across the globe. Over the years
we have experimented with various tools. This page describes some of
the background and conventions we hold ourselves to.

In the age of broadband and webcams it's very easy to have a somewhat immersive conversation over many
thousand kilometers but it requires effort and doesn't come close to the real thing. The non-verbal part of
a meeting gets missed by remote attendees. A study found that 7% of any message is conveyed through words, 38%
through certain vocal elements, and 55% through nonverbal elements (facial expressions, gestures, posture, etc).
Apart from that, having a physical location we all call home and share has other advantages. We care a lot about
the people we work with and having a familiar atmosphere and trust in each other is not just important for
feeling comfortable at work but also makes collaboration much more effective. An office filled with peers who
you respect, who can cheer you up and motivate you is, we believe, a valuable ingredient to making Centrifuge a
successful venture. Spontaneity is another ingredient that can lead to great results and is very hard to
replicate in any remote setting.

The very obvious downside of trying to colocate is that it either requires us to limit our candidate pool to one
geographic location or ask people to move upon starting a job. You also ask all of your colleagues to spend varying
amounts of time commuting.

Personal circumstances can change and that could mean moving to another places on this planet. A job should never
keep you from a happy life. Undoubtedly permanently living in another place will change how you're part of our
tribe and your interaction with everyone else. This does not mean we want to exclude this on principle but it
needs to be a consideration.

There are different types of work and they benefit differnetly from in-person or remote setting. There are
situations where locking yourself in a room and not talking to anyone is the right thing to execute on a
specific task with laser-sharp focus. Sometimes the office is just a bit too distracting or Berlin a tad bit
too cold and grey.

In everything we do, we try to have the least process necessary and the minimum rules required. In this
spirit, this document should give you with some guidelines, the reasoning behind them and empower you to make
decisions about where you work and how you work on your own. And if you are in doubt with any of this, bring
it up in the team and ask your peers as working with them is most important and doing that in a way that is
ideal for both you and your peers should be the goal of these guidelines.


## Asynchronous Communication
We use a few tools to encourage asynchronous communication. This has huge benefits
not just in helping with people who are are in different timezones but also creating
a written record of decisions and learnings that can be referneced later.

### Running Notes
For meetings and team syncs, a format we often use is a single hackmd where we keep track
of of the agenda and results for each meeting adding a new heading and section at the top
for the next meeting adding follow up items to the agenda. A good example are our
[Chain Team Running Notes](https://centrifuge.hackmd.io/@vim/centchain/%2F8C_mW2TlSJWvKBZI_4T1Wg)


## Scheduling meetings
If you are not in your regular timezone, put an all day event into the team calendar indicating what time they
can expect you to be avaialable online.

When an absences is planned out and longer in time, think about any important events within that timeframe.
Planning sessions, work events, releases. See who else is absent during that time. If the people you're most
closely working together haven't been in one place for the last month, adding another 2 weeks of remote work is
not be the best idea right now. Spending a week together could really be useful for everyone to get back in sync.
Likewise, when two or three people already are on vacation or absent from Berlin, you should probably try to be
around so others in the company can come to you for questions. But it could very well be that precisely that
would be the perfect time to be remote as no one in the office could want anything from you. If necessary check
with your peers and make that call yourself.

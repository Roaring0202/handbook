# Apps circle standards/FAQ

The following describes how we want to work together.

## Work packages

1. How many changes per PR? 
   
   We want to release fast and often and hence break down the scope into multiple small commits and PRs.

## PRs

1. How do we name and describe PRs?

   PR title should have a short description on what is changed. The PR description should mention the tickets that are closed by it. 
   Example title: "Update dashboard to December", Example description: "Closes #189, #192"

1. When do we need PR reviews? 
   
   When opening a PR that involves changes to business logic, we commit to request and receive a PR review before merging (to catch bugs and security issues).

2. Until when do we need to do a PR review? 
   
   We want to provide feedback on open PRs until the end of the next working day?
